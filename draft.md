### Keywords
Stylophone, 555 timer, synthesizer

## Introduction
Stylophone is pocket synthesizer which uses voltage-controlled oscilator controlled with stylus which closes circuit in different position on metal keyboard on printed circuit board.

### Goal
Goal of this project is to recreate basic functionality of stylophone using 555 integrated circuit, make it portable by using batery as power source.

### Reason
I wanted to build stylophone with 555 timer for some time yet I did't have sufficient knowladge and understanding of electronics to do it but now with knowladge and skills acquired during first year of my studies I can build stylophone.

### History
Stylophone was invented by Brian Jarvis of Dubreq Studios in 1967 and initialy was produced from 1968 to 1975, but in 2007 production of stylophone was relunched. Version of stylophone from 2007 used digital electronics unlike original but in 2020 Dubreq released new analog version of stylophone which uses 555 timer integrated circuit as its heart.

Number of widly known artists used stylophone in the past like The White Stripes, David Bowie or Jarvis Cocker. These days stylophone can be heard in various genres or in full stylophone covers of popular songs.

## 555
555 integrated circuit, designed in 1971 by Hans Camenzind, is said to be the most popular integrated circuit ever made. 555 can be used in many configuration like: oscilators, schmit triggers, SR latches and many more.
## Design

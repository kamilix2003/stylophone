	\subsection{555 astable operation}
	
	555 documentation provides example circuit for astable mode of operations and formulas for properties of oscillations.
	
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:1}
		t_1 = A \cdot (R_a + R_b) C
	\end{equation}
	
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:2}
		t_2 = A \cdot R_b \space C
	\end{equation}
	
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:3}
		T = t_1 + t_2 
	\end{equation}
	
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:4}
		D = \dfrac{R_b}{R_a + 2R_b}
	\end{equation}
	
	$t_1$ - charge time, $t_2$ - discharge time, $T$ - period, $D$ - duty cycle \\
	$A = 0.693$ is constant provided in documentation

	\subsubsection{Duty cycle}
	Let's start with finding suitable component values considering duty cycle first because it is dependent on least amount of variables.
	We want duty cycle to be as close to 50\% as it is possible at least for now. According to formula \ref{eq:1} we can see that
	\begin{equation}
		\lim_{R_a \to 0} \dfrac{R_b}{R_a + 2R_b} = 0.5
	\end{equation}
	or
	\begin{equation}
		\lim_{R_b \to \infty} \dfrac{R_b}{R_a + 2R_b} = 0.5
	\end{equation}
	
	Knowing that we should choose resistance $R_a$ to be quite small and resistance $R_b$ to be much greater than $R_a$. 
	By plotting Duty cycle against resistance $R_b$ with different resistances $R_a$ we can see that in order for duty cycle to be above 48\% $R_b$ must be approximately one magnitude greater than $R_a$.

	\end{figure}
	
	Before choosing $R_a$ we need to consider maximum power dissipation of the resistor and supply voltage. Resistor $R_a$ with value of 10$\Omega$ or smaller would be great to achieve 50\% duty cycle but quickly we would realized that something is smelling weird and is really hot.
	
	Power dissipation of a resistor can be calculated using formula.
	\begin{equation}
		P = \frac{V^2}{R}
	\end{equation}
	Looking first at the voltage, 555 IC requires at least 4.5V and supply voltage will not exceed 6.5V. The most common resistors used in electronic circuits have power rating of 0.25W or 1W.
	
	Knowing all restrictions we can choose the most suitable resistor $R_a$
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $R_a = 47\Omega$ for $P_{max} = 1W$
		\item $R_a = 220\Omega$ for $P_{max} = 0.25W$
	\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Frequency range}
	Now let's consider value of capacitor C in our circuit.

	Stylophone's keyboard has 20 notes, one full octave, 3 notes from octave below and 5 notes above. frequency of each note can be calculated using one of following formulas
	
	\begin{equation}
		f = 2^{\frac{n}{12}} \cdot 440 \text{Hz}
	\end{equation}
	where $n$ is note number
	\begin{equation}
		f = 2^{\frac{p-69}{12}}  \cdot 440 \text{Hz}
	\end{equation}
	where $p$ is MIDI note number
